# Homework-1 - HTML, CSS and Git: Code Refactor

My goal in this project was to develop my skills by improving existing code without changing how it functions. This was guided by the following - 

# User Story:

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

# Acceptance Criterea:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# What I Did:

1. Orgainised semantic structure of HTML Elements by substituting <header>, <section>, <article> and <footer> tags inplace of the previous <div> tags.
2.  Added descriptive comments to organise index.html & style.css documents for clarity.
3. Fixed broken link in Navigation Bar.
4. Added descriptive alt atributes to all HTML images. Also added role="img" aria-label= to section tag that included an image embeded via CSS, allowing me to add an alt attribute.
5. Rearranged CSS document into sections that correspond with HTML doc to allow ease of future editing.
6. Changed footer to a <h4> tag to facilitate standard sequential order. Due to .footer class in CSS this did not modify the look of the webpage.
7. I added a descriptive title - Horiseon Social Solution Services.
